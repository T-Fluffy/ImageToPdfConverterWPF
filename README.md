This is a WPF application using Dotnet7 with vs_code to convert images into a pdf file. It was created to play around with the dotnet WPF development technology and to discover its options for creating a useful tool.
This tool is very useful and can be further improved.

## Packages used :

- PdfSharp, version 6.0.0
- System.Drawing.Common, version 8.0.1
  and the System.Windows.Forms.

## notes :

This tool is very useful and can be further improved.

The user has to select the input folder where the source images are located, choose the output folder, and name the PDF destination file that will be created. Finally, they can initiate the conversion. The process will terminate after the window below is displayed:
